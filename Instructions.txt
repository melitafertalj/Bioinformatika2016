Installation and running:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many Linux distributions have Python preinstalled, and Bio Linux is one of
them, so to run this implementation of SA-DS algorithm, you would only need
to:

   1) Clone this Git branch.

   2) Position the terminal in the correct folder (the one containing the 
      script) and run the script using:

          python sa-ds.py <input.txt> <output.txt>

Input and output may be in other folders but then make sure the path is
specified.


Additional information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This branch contains two scripts: sa-ds.py and sa-ds-elaborate.py. They both
have the same algorithm implemented in the same way. The difference is in
the output:

   a) If you want to see only the suffix array in your output file, then run
      sa-ds.py.

   b) If you are interested to see how the algorithm works, run the 
      sa-ds-elaborate.py and the output will contain step by step 
      information.

The Tests folder contains 13 testing inputs: 11 synthetic arrays (clo1.txt - 
clo11.txt) and 2 genomes of existing bacteria (haemo.txt and entero.txt). 

The Output folder contains the results sa-ds.py gives for any of these 
testing examples from the Tests folder.

The file titled Measurements.txt contains information on how much time and 
memory it took the sa-ds.py to provide results for 13 examples enclosed in 
the Tests folder.

There is also a script titled sortingTest.py which, for provided input and 
output produced by sa-ds.py (it will not work for the output of 
sa-ds-elaborate.py), checks if the output is correctly sorted, and finds the 
position of the first error if it is not.
